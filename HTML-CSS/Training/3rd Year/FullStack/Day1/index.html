			<h2>Industrial Robot</h2>
			<p>
				Industrial robots automate processes in manufacturing
				environments like factories and warehouses. Possessing at least
				one robotic arm, these robots are made to handle heavy objects
				while moving with speed and precision. As a result, industrial
				robots often work in assembly lines to boost productivity.

			<h2>Medical Robot</h2>
			<p>
				Medical robots assist healthcare professionals in various
				scenarios and support the physical and mental health of humans.
				These robots rely on AI and sensors to navigate healthcare
				facilities, interact with humans and execute precise movements.
				Some medical robots can even converse with humans, encouraging
				peopleâ€™s social and emotional growth.

			<h2>Robot - Nino</h2>
			<p>
				Nino is a humanoid that can talk, walk, dance, sing, play and
				work wonders with its inherently built intelligence. For each
				concept that a teacher covers in her classroom, Nino has a set
				of innovative, developmentally appropriate, hands-on,
				experiential and interactive activities, stories, poems and
				projects that can be used to introduce, strengthen, summarize
				and assess concepts

			<h2>Micro Robot</h2>
			<p>
				Microrobotics is the study and development of robots on a
				miniature scale. Often no bigger than a millimeter, microrobots
				can vary in size, depending on the situation. Biotech
				researchers typically use microrobotics to monitor and treat
				diseases, with the goal of improving diagnostic tools and
				creating more targeted solutions.

			<h2>Agricultural Robot</h2>
			<p>
				Agricultural robots handle repetitive and labor-intensive tasks,
				allowing farmers to use their time and energy more efficiently.
				These robots also operate in greenhouses, where they monitor
				crops and help with harvests. Agricultural robots come in many
				forms, ranging from autonomous tractors to drones that collect
				data for farmers to analyze.
